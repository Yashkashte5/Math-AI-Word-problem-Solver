# Math-AI-Word-problem-Solver
Created an AI-powered application to solve mathematical word problems using natural language processing and
machine learning.
• Utilized TensorFlow for developing machine learning models to interpret and solve math problems.
• Employed NLTK for natural language processing to parse and understand the problem statements.
• Built an interface using Tkinter to allow users to input problems and view solutions.
